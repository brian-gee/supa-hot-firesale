  ## Description

  This project was created as way to show our skills when creating a full stack app. We implemented React, Graphql, MongoDB, Heroku for deployment, and other NPM dependencies that can be found under our package.json. In this Full Stack App you we allow users to create an account in order to buy some of the items we have listed in our home page. We provide 3 modals: sign up, login, and the cart; letting the user focus only at the action requested. We also implemented ways to allow users to sort through some of our items by selecting one of the categories and it will render only the items within that category, plus we added a button with function to clear all the categories selected so the website will render all items again.

  ## Installation

  When the user download the repository to their computer, they must run "npm install" in order to install all packages into their device and be able to run the app without any issues. The user must also be able to create an account for heroku and mongoDB atlas if they would like to deploy this app as well. Cluster and some settings need to be fix in MongoDB atlas in order to allow heroku to deploy this app without any issues. Another action the user needs to take in order to run this app, its the npm run seed in order to populate the database with the information provided by our seed.

  ## Usage

  This app was created with the intent to be use as a retail website, for multiple products and allowing user to interact with a private account so their choices are saved and store to a database.
